new problems 
3 problems 
1. first problem was to think of a way to save the data to the console. which was easier then Ithought.
2. when I fixed the first problem 2 others came. the button function that alert that I need to write something stoped working. the problem was quite easy because the order of the code was wrong. So I needed to put it in the right order. the same thing was with the third problem.

3. The localStorage stoped working it showed that I didn't call the function and when I did I put it in wrong order.
