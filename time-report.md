2024-02-09
I think it took me 3 or 4 hours the entire project
I was commited and had free time

css didn't take that long because I already had an idea and wanted to follow the design as clearly as possible

For example:

- 2022-10-24 18:00 Worked for 1 hour.
  - _List the things you have done._

Should be finish 
- 2024-02-16 worked on it for 2 days.
